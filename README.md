# Futures-trading-projects
# Welcome to my Futures Trading Project. This repository documents my personal journey into the world of futures markets—starting from scratch and building toward a fully functioning algorithmic trading strategy.
# The goal of this project is to:
## •	Understand the mechanics of futures contracts
## •	Explore market data and common trading indicators
## •	Design, test, and optimize algorithmic trading strategies
## •	Evaluate performance using key financial metrics (Sharpe ratio, drawdown, etc.)
## •	Ultimately, develop a robust and systematic trading strategy for live or simulated trading
